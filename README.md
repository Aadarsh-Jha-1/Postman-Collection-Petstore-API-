## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Postman to automate API testing for the PetStore API, available at [https://petstore.swagger.io/](https://petstore.swagger.io/). The tests focus on performing CRUD operations on the Pet, Store, and User modules. The project is structured to follow best practices by utilizing Postman features like variables (collection and global), dynamic pre-request scripts, test scripts for response validation, and API chaining. 

In addition, the project is integrated with **Newman**, the command-line tool for Postman, to run collections in an automated environment and generate detailed HTML reports for analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Postman**: A popular tool for API testing, enabling the creation, testing, and automation of API requests.
- **Newman**: A CLI tool for running Postman collections from the command line, ideal for continuous integration (CI) environments.
- **JavaScript**: Used for writing test scripts to validate API responses and pre-request scripts to generate dynamic data.
- **Postman Collection Runner**: A feature to run entire collections and test APIs in bulk.
- **API Chaining**: The process of passing dynamic data from one request to the next to simulate real-world workflows.

## Project Structure

The project follows a well-organized structure with folders and files that separate different functionalities and modules.
```graphql

```


### Folder & File Descriptions:

1. **IndividualModules**:
   - **Pet Module.postman_collection.json**: Contains all API requests for performing CRUD operations on the Pet module (create, read, update, delete pets).
   - **Store Module.postman_collection.json**: Contains all API requests for interacting with the store (managing inventory, placing orders).
   - **User Module.postman_collection.json**: Contains all API requests for managing users (creating, updating, and deleting users).

2. **NewmanReport**:
   - Contains HTML reports generated after running the Postman collections using **Newman**, which is useful for continuous integration and analysis.

3. **Petstore-API-Collection.postman_collection.json**: A full Postman collection that combines all the modules (Pet, Store, and User) into a single collection, enabling you to run all tests at once.

4. **README.md**: This file, which provides an overview of the project, instructions for setting up and running the tests, and other useful information.

## Features and Implementation

### API Chaining
API chaining is implemented to create dynamic workflows where the output of one API call is used as input for subsequent requests. This ensures that actions like creating a user or pet and placing an order happen in a realistic sequence.

### Dynamic Variables and Pre-request Scripts
- **Pre-request scripts** are used to create dynamic data, such as generating user IDs, pet IDs, and order numbers, which are passed in the request body or as query parameters.
- **Collection variables** store values that need to be reused across multiple requests within a collection, such as base URLs or authentication tokens.
- **Global variables** store values that are accessible across collections, making it easy to handle frequently used data such as login credentials.

### Test Scripts (Post-response validation)
- **Test scripts** are written in JavaScript to validate API responses. These include checking status codes, ensuring the correct data is returned, and verifying response times.
  
Example of a test script:
```javascript
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Response contains pet name", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.body('doggie');
});
```

### Running the Collection in Postman

1. Import the Postman collection(s) into Postman.
2. Set up environment or global variables as needed.
3. Run individual requests or execute the entire collection using the **Collection Runner**.

### Running with Collection Runner
To run the collection using Postman’s Collection Runner:
- Open the collection in Postman.
- Click on the "Runner" button at the top-right.
- Select the appropriate environment and hit "Run".

### Running via Newman
To run the collection from the command line using **Newman**, follow these steps:

1. Install Newman if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install -g newman
   ```
2. Execute the collection with the following command:
   ```bash
   newman run Petstore-API-Collection.postman_collection.json --reporters cli,html --reporter-html-export NewmanReport/newman_report.html
   ```

This will run all the API requests and generate a detailed HTML report in the **NewmanReport** folder.

## Prerequisites

- **Postman**: Ensure you have Postman installed to run and test the collections in the Postman GUI.
- **Newman**: Install Newman to run the collection tests from the command line.
  ```bash
  npm install -g newman
  ```
